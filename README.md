Faceit
======
Can we really tell if people are focusing on you on videochat or not? In real life,  people raise their eyebrow when they doubt something they hear, people wink as a sign of intimacy, people look around when they lose interest in chat. How about virtual world?
Ilwon and I have done some experiment on it, we asked people “what is the most annoying habbit when you do video chat?” Finally we found that people do care if someone is looking at the screen or not, and it may not be polite to type your keyboard, view browser at the same time when you do video chatting.
Faceit is a chatting room turn people into a better chatter, we want you look at your chatter, focus on screen, no turn left and right. We are using facetrackr javascript library to get face position. When you are distracted to  a certain degree, your window is closed.
